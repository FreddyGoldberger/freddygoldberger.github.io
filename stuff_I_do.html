								<h3>SmartCurtain Prototype 4</h3>
									<p>The SmartCurtain, is a low cost module designed to automate the opening and closing of blinds, providing convenience and confort for users. By leveraging the power of the ESP32 WiFi connectivity. The end goal of the SmartCurtain is to offer seamless control and integration into your smart home ecosystem.</p>

									<p>At the heart of SmartCurtain lies a PID control algorithm. This algorithm enables precise and smooth movement of the blinds by utilizing a low speed, high torque DC motor equipped with an encoder. The PID control algorithm ensures accurate positioning and guaranteeing a reliable and consistent user experience.</p>
									
									<p>SmartCurtain's WiFi compatibility allows users to effortlessly operate the module from anywhere within their network. Whether you're at home or away, you can conveniently control the blinds' movements through a dedicated mobile app or integrate it with your existing smart home automation system. This level of control brings enhanced convenience, security, and energy efficiency to your living space.</p>

								<h3>SmartCurtain Prototype 3</h3>
									<p>The prototype 3 of the SmartCurtain was aiming to have similar capabilities as the prototype 4 previously mentioned but instead of using WiFi for the conectivity the wireless communication was over Nordic nRF24L01+ using a hub to connect allow the system to reach the Internet via WiFi through a Acorn Module v1 from Digistump.com that unfortunately was not a successful product in the market rendering this prototype useless as a release candidate for the future.</p>

								<h3>WiMega3</h3>
									<p>The WiMega3, was designed to enhance the wireless control capabilities of commercially available relay boards. By integrating the WiMega3 module with a relay board, users gain the ability to remotely manage the ON/OFF state of the relays through wireless connectivity. This module leverages the nRF24L01+ wireless communication module, facilitating seamless and reliable communication between the relays and the control interface.</p>

									<p>The WiMega3 module interfaces with the relay board via the WiMegaUSB connector, which establishes connectivity with a computer. This connection allows users to access a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) application, enabling intuitive control over the state of the devices connected to the relays. Through the GUI application, users can conveniently toggle the relays ON or OFF with just a few clicks, eliminating the need for manual switching or physical access to the relay board.</p>
										
									<p>This project offers a flexible and convenient solution for remotely controlling various devices connected to the relays, streamlining operations and enhancing user experience. With WiMega3, managing the power state of connected devices becomes effortless, providing users with greater control and convenience over their systems.</p>

								<h2>Leadership</h2>
								<h3>Global Support Management</h3>
									<p>As the Global Support Supervisor, I successfully led a team of engineers through significant growth and improvements, resulting in remarkable achievements. Over the course of my tenure, the engineering team expanded from 3 to 20 skilled professionals. Through our collective efforts, we were able to improve the Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance by 40%.</p>

									<p>To achieve this level of success, we focused on enhancing our systems, documentation, and tools. By implementing robust processes and streamlining workflows, we were able to deliver exceptional support services to our clients. I actively participated in the documentation and process implementation, ensuring that our team complied with ISO9001 certification standards. This meticulous attention to detail and adherence to quality management principles further enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations.</p>
									
									<p>One of my notable responsibilities was overseeing the improvement of our virtualization infrastructure. I spearheaded two major renovation projects for the virtualization cluster, each with a substantial budget of nearly half a million dollars allocated for hardware and labor. These upgrades significantly bolstered our system's performance, scalability, and reliability, allowing us to meet the evolving demands of our clients and provide seamless support service delivery.</p>
									
									<p>Overall, my role as Global Support Supervisor was characterized by a relentless commitment to excellence, continuous process improvement, and strategic project management. These accomplishments are a testament to the dedication and hard work of the entire team, as we collectively strived to exceed expectations and drive meaningful change within the organization.</p>

								<h3>Software Development Management</h3>
									<p>As the Manager of Software Development, I have successfully addressed a critical staffing challenge within the team. When I took over, we were operating at only 70% of the budgeted personnel. Through strategic initiatives, I led the team to reach full capacity, with 100% of the positions filled. This accomplishment was achieved by implementing improvements in our recruitment process, refining job descriptions to attract top talent, and enhancing interview questions and assessments to ensure we selected the right candidates.</p>

									<p>In addition to addressing staffing concerns, I have played a pivotal role in transforming our project management approach. We have transitioned from the traditional waterfall methodology to the Agile framework. Embracing the principles of Lean and conducting scrum meetings and ceremonies, we have fostered a more collaborative and adaptive work environment. This shift has allowed us to be more responsive to change, deliver incremental value, and optimize our productivity and efficiency.</p>
									
									<p>A key aspect of my management approach has been focused on boosting team morale and creating an inclusive environment. By fostering a culture where individuals feel safe to share their ideas and propose solutions, I have encouraged active participation and engagement from all team members. This inclusive atmosphere has resulted in a wealth of innovative ideas, improved problem-solving capabilities, and strengthened team cohesion.</p>
									
									<p>Overall, as the Manager of Software Development, I have successfully addressed staffing challenges, championed Agile practices, and cultivated an inclusive work environment. These efforts have not only improved team performance but have also enhanced overall project outcomes, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and success.</p>
